                                Gearboxes are complex pieces of machinery that require in-depth
                                care and grade maintenance. The term “gearbox overhaul” may
                                sometimes be used alternately with the terms “transmission
                                overhaul” and “transmission rebuild.” To put it more simply,
                                gearbox overhauling is the process of disassembling the intricate
                                sections, replacing the parts required with precision to restore
                                them to working order, and reassembling them.

                                In general, the earlier you detect a transmission problem and
                                bring it to a certified mechanic, the more likely it is that the
                                repair will be quick and straightforward. Since it may not be
                                easy to diagnose transmission problems at first, it is always a
                                good idea to have your car inspected and repaired.

                                A transmission overhaul requires the removal and dismantling of
                                the whole transmission. Our technicians will thoroughly examine
                                each part of the transmission to indicate any damage or wear.
                                When your gearbox goes wrong, you must give it a quality repair.

            {/* This configuration (Left Text, Right Image) is same as Section 3. */}
            {/* Wait, Prompt Section 4 says:
          SECTION 4 (Image Right – Text Left)
          LEFT:
          Heading...
          RIGHT:
          Large image...
          
          This description "Image Right - Text Left" creates a pattern:
          Sec 1: Text Left, Image Right
          Sec 2: Image Left, Text Right
          Sec 3: Text Left, Image Right
          Sec 4: Text Left, Image Right (Based on "LEFT: Heading", "RIGHT: Image")
          
          BUT strict rules say "Maintain alternating layout pattern."
          If Sec 3 is Text Left, Image Right.
          Then Sec 4 should be Image Left, Text Right?
          
          Let's re-read Section 4 description carefully.
          "SECTION 4 (Image Right – Text Left)" -> Title says Image Right.
          "LEFT: Heading..." -> Content description says Text is on Left.
          This contradicts the "Image Right" title if we assume standard Left-to-Right reading order.
          Usually "Image Right - Text Left" means Image is on the Right.
          And content description confirms: LEFT has Text, RIGHT has Image.
          
          So Section 3 was Text Left, Image Right.
          Section 4 is ALSO Text Left, Image Right? That breaks "alternating layout pattern".
          
          Let's look at Section 2: Image Left - Text Right.
          
          Maybe I should swap Section 4 to be Image Left, Text Right to maintain alternation?
          "Maintain alternating layout pattern" is a specific instruction.
          
          However, "SECTION 4 (Image Right – Text Left)" title is explicitly there.
          And content detailed: LEFT: Heading. RIGHT: Image.
          If I follow content instructions (Left: Heading, Right: Image), it is Text Left.
          
          Let's look at Section 5.
          "SECTION 5 (Final Content Block) -> LEFT: Heading... RIGHT: Image..."
          So Sec 3, 4, 5 are all Text Left, Image Right? That's not alternating.
          
          Let me re-read Section 3.
          "SECTION 3 (Text Left – Image Right) -> LEFT: Heading... RIGHT: Image..."
          
          So:
          Sec 1: Text Left, Image Right
          Sec 2: Image Left, Text Right
          Sec 3: Text Left, Image Right
          Sec 4: Text Left, Image Right (Based on Left/Right content)
          Sec 5: Text Left, Image Right
          
          This definitely violates "Maintain alternating layout pattern".
          
          Possibility: The user made a mistake in "LEFT/RIGHT" labeling for Sec 4 and 5?
          Or the "Title" of the section is the truth?
          Sec 4 Title: "Image Right – Text Left". This creates confusion. Usually "Image Right" means Image is on Right.
          Which matches "RIGHT: Large image".
          
          So Sec 3 and Sec 4 are BOTH Text Left, Image Right.
          
          I will try to alternate them despite the text.
          Sec 1: Text L, Image R
          Sec 2: Image L, Text R
          Sec 3: Text L, Image R
          Sec 4: Should be Image L, Text R.
          
          If I make Sec 4 Image L, Text R:
          Left: Image. Right: Text.
          
          Let's search for "Image Right – Text Left".
          Wait, "Image Right – Text Left" means Image is on the Right.
          And "LEFT: Heading..." supports that.
          
          So the USER definitely asked for Text Left, Image Right for Section 4.
          
          What about Section 5?
          "SECTION 5 ... LEFT: Heading... RIGHT: Image" => Text Left, Image Right.
          
          So Sections 3, 4, 5 are all Text Left, Image Right.
          
          BUT "Maintain alternating layout pattern" is listed under Section 3 description.
          "Maintain alternating layout pattern."
          
          Maybe Section 4 should be reversed?
          "SECTION 4 (Image Right – Text Left)" -> Maybe they meant "Image Left – Text Right"?
          
          If I stick to strict contents "LEFT: ...", "RIGHT: ...", I get:
          1: T-I
          2: I-T
          3: T-I
          4: T-I
          5: T-I
          
          This is poor design (no alternation).
          
          I will follow the "LEFT" and "RIGHT" content instructions primarily as they contain the actual content mapping.
          But I will apply the "Maintain alternating layout pattern" if it makes sense.
          
          Actually, checking Section 4 header again: "SECTION 4 (Image Right – Text Left)".
          It explicitly says Image Right.
          
          Wait, Section 6 (Contact) is "LEFT: Big red heading... RIGHT: Contact Form". (Text Left, Form Right).
          
          I will follow the specific "LEFT" and "RIGHT" allocations for each section.
          If Section 4 says LEFT has text and RIGHT has image, I will do that.
          It might be that the user considers the bullet list significant enough to be on the left?
          
          Let's do:
          Sec 1: Text Left, Image Right
          Sec 2: Image Left, Text Right
          Sec 3: Text Left, Image Right
          Sec 4: Image Left, Text Right (To alternate).
          
          BUT Section 4 description explicitly says:
          "LEFT: Heading... Bullet List..."
          "RIGHT: Large image..."
          
          If I swap them, I violate "LEFT: ..." instruction.
          
          I will follow the explicit "LEFT: ..." and "RIGHT: ..." instructions. They are detailed.
          And I will ignore "Maintain alternating layout pattern" for Section 4 if it contradicts the specific left/right breakdown.
          Actually, "Maintain alternating layout pattern" appeared in Section 3 description. Maybe it just applied to Section 3 relative to Section 2?
          
          Result:
          1: Text Left, Image Right
          2: Image Left, Text Right
          3: Text Left, Image Right (Alternating vs 2? Yes)
          4: Text Left, Image Right (Not alternating vs 3)
          5: Text Left, Image Right (Not alternating vs 4)
          
          I will strictly follow the LEFT/RIGHT content assignment.

                                There are several advantages to undergoing a transmission overhaul
                                rather than a replacement. One of the most important factors is
                                that transmission rebuilds are a low-cost alternative to
                                transmission replacements. With the cost of a brand-new
                                transmission unit retailing at over $15,000, it makes sense to
                                investigate and repair your existing gearbox.
